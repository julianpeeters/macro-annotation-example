### An example SBT project which uses [macro paradise](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/paradise.html), forked from @Xeno_by

Macro annotations are currently released as a compiler plugin, and may be included in a future release of Scala, so I'm checking to see if they will allow me to use a dynamically defined class as a type parameter, parse its new pickled Scala signature annotation, and de/serialize with Salat.
