### An example SBT project which uses [macro paradise](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/paradise.html), forked from @Xeno_by

I'm checking to see if macro annotations will allow me to use a dynamically defined class as a type parameter, parse its new pickled Scala signature annotation, and access its member names and types with Scala reflection.  

Please see other branches for more examples.
